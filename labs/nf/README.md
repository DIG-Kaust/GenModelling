## Notebooks
The following notebooks is provided:

- :orange_book: ``NF_mnist.ipynb``: notebook illustrating how to set up a normalizing flow using the normflows package and build a generative model using the MNIST dataset.

## Getting started :space_invader: :robot:
To ensure reproducibility of the results, we suggest using the `environment.yml` file when creating an environment.

Simply run:
```
./install_env.sh
```
It will take some time, if at the end you see the word `Done!` on your terminal you are ready to go.

Remember to always activate the environment by typing:
```
conda activate normalizing_flows
```

> **Note** <br>
> All experiments have been carried on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.10GHz equipped with a single NVIDIA GEForce RTX 3090 GPU. Different 
> environment configurations may be required for different combinations of workstation and GPU.
